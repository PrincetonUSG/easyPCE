Explanation of Registrar Parsing files:

Todo: incorporate scrapers and figure out how to ignore cancelled classes...

BACKUP DB Before modifying

To update a semester, first one must obtain the registrar JSON data files.
Copy the basic registrar scraper into a new directory within the DATA
section with an appropriate name. Run it with the selected semester(s).

When finished, open up the regis_parser.py file and modify the DIR at the top
to point to the location of the new files. Run it on that directory.

Second, one must update the distribution areas and PDF information. This is 
done using the DA scraper and the PDF scraper. See their appropriate headers
for more information. This should conclude updating the database with the appropriate
info.
