<h1>Timeline Document</h1>

<h3>March 11, 2013</h3>
<p>We had our first meeting to begin design plans for the course review project. We sketched out potential layouts of pages and discussed desired features, ranking some as very important, moderately important, and minimally important. We did this to get an idea of how we move forward.</p>
<hr/>

<h3>March 13, 2013</h3>
<p>We met again to formalize our ideas and finalize design plans. We decided to use a Python/Django framework to run the site and a MySQL server on the backend.</p>
<p>Also today, we emailed Candy Button (a former 333 student who did her independent work on a project similar to ours) about scraping the data from the current course evaluations site for use on our site. She sent us a version of her script, which we plan to modify to fit our specs.</p>
<hr/>

<h3>March 25, 2013</h3>
<p>Post Spring Break Meeting: We met today to discuss updates from spring break. We all got familiar with the technologies we are planning on using (Django, MySQL, and Heroku). Yacob set up a preliminary Heroku server and got a Hello World site going. Major goal for the next week: solidify curling script and learn about BeautifulSoup API for HTML parsing so that we can finish up the parsing script</p>
<hr/>

<h3>April 1, 2013</h3>
<p>We finished the curling script. When we were about to start running the script, we decided to make the switch to using Amazon EC2 instead of Heroku because we came to the realization that we get a lot more server space through Amazon. Matt set an instance up with an elastic IP of <a href="http://54.244.122.240">54.244.122.240</a>. We got our curling script running on the server; it is going to take a very long time so we are just going to set up a daemon process to run until finished. Current next step: solidify structure of database and finish parsing script so we are ready to get that started when the curling finishes.</p>

<hr/>
<h3>April 3, 2013</h3>
<p>Parsing script is ready to go. Once we learned BeautifulSoup, it went pretty smoothly. That is set up and ready to go for when the curling is finished. Curling is having some issues, but we are sorting them out currently. Also, we discussed database structure. Current next step: create the tables and edit the parsing script to push the data right into the database.</p>

<hr />
<h3> April 9, 2013 </h3>
<p>We got to work on scraping the registrar because course review HTML files don't include relevant info like professors, descriptions, etc. Therefore, we have got all of the data from the registrar. Now, we just need to parse it into the database.</p>

<hr />
<h3> April 12, 2013 </h3>
<p> After working on the registrar parsing, we realized that there were some issues with our original database schema, such as cross-listed courses or courses taught by more than one professor. Therefore, we updated the schema and are finishing up the parsing at the moment. Also, we have got Bootstrap set up so we are beginning on redesigned the UI because our pre-Bootstrap UI wasn't looking too good. That is the goal for the next day or two: getting a nice UI up for our home page that will be applied to all the other pages. </p>

<hr />
<h3> April 15, 2013 </h3>
<p> We have implemented basic search functionality. There is a search bar on the home page that does very simple querying of the database. However, we are in the process of reloading the database with both data from the registrar and data from course reviews. For that reason, we don't get very interesting results. The basics are there though </p>

<hr />
<h3> April 18, 2013 </h3>
<p> Now, we have our main page up and running. We have the parsing scripts at work to fill the database. From here, we are going to CSSify because when we first made the main page, there was a lot of inline CSS. Also, we are going to continue to work on search for the next day or two to get the functionality to a higher level. </p>

<hr />
<h3> April 22, 2013 </h3>
<p> We have completely finished parsing all of the advice into the advice with the most recent database schema;
that should be good for now. Also, we have finished up a new view for a course that includes tabbing by semester.
By setting up JQuery, we are able to have dynamic tabbing for all of the data for a semester.
Finally, we have also made our search bar on the home page redirect to the appropriate course, department, or
professor page (if we received a legal query). </p>

<hr />
<h3> April 24, 2013 </h3>
<p> We made a search results page and decided to add a search bar to every view for ease of use. Also, the search results are
sorted by result type. Next, we hope to have an advanced search feature. Additionally, the course view was improved a bit; having a 
bit of trouble with the dropdown layout idea.</p>

<hr />
<h3> April 26, 2013 </h3>
<p> Started work on favorites. Learned more about Django forms. Made search smarter as well.</p>

<hr />
<h3> April 30, 2013 </h3>
<p> Met to discuss final project goals before demo day. Bought and set
   up url at easypce.com ('Easy Peasy'). Have basic graphs implemented
   on course page. Eliminated superfluous data from database. Set up
   solution for professors whose NetIDs we can't access.</p>

<hr />
<h3> May 4, 2013 </h3>
<p> Added animations to graphs. Began looking at auto-complete. Planned out
 way to rank courses using Bayesian statistics. Revamped Nav-Bar</p>

<hr />
<h3> May 9, 2013 </h3>
<p> Major progress. Completely revamped the front page. Added Bayesian
 rankings. Created a manage favorites page. Dropdowns added to nav-bar.
New logo created. Final preps made for demo-day</p>

<hr />
<h3> May 11, 2013 </h3>
<p> Handful of bug fixes in preparation for launch. Launched to great 
fanfare but fifteen minutes of downtime due to our own AWS flub-up. </p>

<hr />
<h3> May 13, 2013 </h3>
<p> Hit 1000 unique users! Meeting with USG tomorrow. Things are looking
good. </p>
