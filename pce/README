### How to update files after DB updated. ###


The main issue here is updating the Bayesian information. I need from help from
Matt on this one, but I think the gist is you calculate them, and then put them
in the file ratings_final or whatever. Then, you run bayes_into_db on that FILE
(i.e. open bayes_into_db and check the directory it's pointing to). After
fixing Bayesian, update the cached queryset!!!

Secondly, make sure you run professordept fixer. Read through the code to make 
sure it's all ok.
